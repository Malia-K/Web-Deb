            Nobody’s born <em>smart</em>. We all start at 0. Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do algebra.<br>
            <strong>Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. Nobody’s good at anything at first.</strong><br>
            There was a time when Einstein couldn’t count to 10.<br>
            And <strong>Shakespeare </strong>had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us.<br>
            Thankfully, we are born to learn.<br>
            <em>Slowly. Surely. </em>You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.<br>
            Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.<br>
            Until one day, you walk.<br>
            One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
            Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger.<br>
            Failing is just another word for growing. And you keep going.<br>
            This. is. learning.<br>
            It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
            You just don’t get it, yet.
            Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe<br>
            are built on basic ideas that anyone, anywhere can understand.<br>
            Whoever you are, wherever you are.<br>
